## Unit Overview

If you haven't worked with the command line before, it can be much more intimidating than working with the standard GUI. However, once you get comfortable with it you will find that the command line is both easier and substantially quicker than clicking all over the place.

In this unit you will customize your terminal and install new software to make working with the command line more powerful. With great power there must also come great responsibility -- be careful of anything that requires you to use `sudo` to install. Sometimes it is necessary, but often we can find ways around it.
