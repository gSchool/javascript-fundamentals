## Resources

A developer spends a great deal of time on a keyboard. For both productivity and health reasons, proper keyboard skills are essential. Here are just a few arguments:

- The less you have to think about typing the more you can focus on the task at hand.
- Just like a musician missing a note, mistyping a word can significantly throw off your focus.
- Repetitive stress injuries and carpal tunnel are very real. Typing with proper form and posture can go a long way to avoiding any typing-related health issues.
