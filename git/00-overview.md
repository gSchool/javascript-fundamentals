## Standard
By the end of this unit, you will be able to _use Git to submit assignments to Galvanize_. You'll know you're ready to move on when you've passed this unit's [checkpoint](./checkpoint.md).

## Unit overview

An important aspect of taking a course at Galvanize is working in an authentic way, which means writing code on your machine. To do this, you'll need to know how to pull down starter code, make changes, and submit that code to your instructors. The way that's done at Galvanize is with Git and GitHub.

In this unit, you'll be setting up a GitHub account (if you don't already have one), installing Git locally, forking repos, cloning repos, locally adding/committing/pushing, and submitting URLs to Galvanize.

While not a comprehensive introduction to Git, completing this unit will give you just enough knowledge of Git to track your personal code changes.
