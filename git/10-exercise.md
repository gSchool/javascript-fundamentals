### Song Lyrics

Complete the following:

1. Create a new directory called 'song-lyrics'. `cd` into that directory.  
1. Initialize a git repository.
1. Create a new text file with the name of your favorite song. Example: `touch blank-space.txt`
1. Check the status of your repo to confirm that your new file exists and has not yet been added to your repo.
1. Add the new file to your staging area.
1. Commit the new file to you repo with the message "added \[filename\].txt to the repo"
1. Open the file in your text editor and write the first line of the song's lyrics.
1. Check the status of your repo to see your changes.
1. Add your changes to the staging area.
1. Check the status to confirm that your changes have been added to the staging area.
1. Commit the changes to your repository with the message "added first line"
1. Repeat the previous steps, adding the second, third, fourth, and fifth lines of the
song to what you already have written. Commit these lines one at a time.
1. Run the fancy git log command (`git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`)
to see your commit history. You should see your 5 commits have been added to the
graph. Congrats! You've used the `git add` and `git commit` commands to add
and track changes to your project.
