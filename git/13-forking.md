# Forking Repositories

You can't just push code to anyone's repository -- that would be madness! However, sometimes we'll want to create a copy of someone's code so that we can work on it as well. Forking is one way to do this.

> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. - [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

When you clone a repository, you're connecting to that version of the code. With forking, you create your own version on your own GitHub account. You can fork any repository you have access to. Simply click the **Fork** button in the upper right-hand corner of the GitHub repository.
