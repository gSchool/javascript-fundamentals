# Overview

## Unit Overview

When we think of interactions we have with web pages, we're often thinking about manipulating the Document Object Model, a representation of our HTML file. DOM Manipulation refers to changing the structure of our page while users are interacting with it. JavaScript was created for this specific purpose and overall does a pretty great job of it! By manipulating the DOM you will be able to show warning messages to your users, build fluid and exciting animations, create games, and much more.

In this unit you will learn how to modify the DOM. By the end of this unit you will have a basic understanding of how to retrieve information from a page, as well as modify a page when it loads.
