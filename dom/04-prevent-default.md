# Default Behavior & Forms

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Hijack forms to prevent the default behavior and manipulate values from a form using `event`

## Resources

Some elements have some default behavior they perform when they are interacted with. For example, links try and go places; forms try and submit. While it's great these elements work out of the box on their own, we often want to hijack this functionality with our own code. This lesson will show you how to do that.
