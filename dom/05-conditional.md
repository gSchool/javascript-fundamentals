# Conditional Events

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Conditionally perform operations with events

## Resources

Often you will only want to fire events if something else on the page is true. For example, take a look [at the following JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/gSchool/g67_fiddles/tree/master/optional-form-submit). You should see that it's the same as the prior example except that now if a name is not added, we perform a different action than we would were we to have a name in there. Try it out and identify which lines are making that change.
