## Unit Overview

HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the foundational language for building websites. HTML is a simple language that can help us define the structure of our page even if it does so verbosely. For students new to web development, the trickiest part of HTML often lies in syntax, spelling, and making sure to add closing tags.

In this unit you will learn how to build simple websites with HTML. You will also learn how to choose your elements appropriately and how to build forms. By the end of this unit, you should have a foundational understanding of what HTML is and how it is used to support the web.
