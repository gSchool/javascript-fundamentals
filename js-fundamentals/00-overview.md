# Overview

## Standard

By the end of this unit, you will be able to utilize the fundamentals of javascript to solve accumulator problems.


## Unit Overview

Consider the following:

```js
"four"
four
4
```

What's the difference between each of these lines? It may not look like much, but each of these lines contains a different data type. Types refer to how information is represented and what we can do with it. This unit will discuss primitive types which you can think of as the basic "nouns" of the JavaScript language.

In this unit you will learn about primitive types and how to utilize them in code. You will also learn how to compare types to one another and see whether or not they are equivalent to each other.
