## Unit Overview

The ability to layout a structure for your webpage is probably the most important thing you can take away from this course. While CSS can affect individual elements such as changing the color of text, it is also used to give space and clarity to your webpage. Because sites are structured similarly, many frameworks have been developed to make this process easier. Even if you don't consider yourself much of a designer, mastering CSS layout is essentially to building websites and will carry you throughout this course.

In this unit you will be focused on building a well-structured page with CSS properties and a CSS Framework. Whereas before we were focused solely on styling individual elements, our goal now is to have those elements work together to create a page that is easy to use.
