# CSS Frameworks

If you've rendered HTML content in a browser without any CSS rules, you're well aware that it looks horrible. CSS frameworks are becoming very popular as a solution to the "ugly by default" problem. A CSS framework is large set of existing CSS rules that helps make your web applications look less ugly.

Such frameworks offload much of the CSS you might otherwise need to write into some sensible default styles, so that you can focus more on building your application and a company specific brand.

There are dozens of CSS Frameworks, and here are two that are popular and well-documented:

- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs)
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)


For this unit we will be focusing on Bootstrap but the concepts we'll go over will translate well to nearly any css framework.
