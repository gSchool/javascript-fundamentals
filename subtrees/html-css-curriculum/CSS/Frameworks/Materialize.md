## What's Material Design?

**Material Design** is a visual language developed by Google that's inspired by the study of paper and ink. It uses typography, grids, space, scale, depth, color, and motion to form a user interface that gives hierarchy, meaning, and focus to content.

To see it in action, watch this video on [Material Design by Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw)

To learn more details, check out the [documentation on Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/environment.html)

### Exercise

After having explored the above resources, turn to a partner and explain what Material Design is in your own words.

## What's the Materialize framework?

A **framework** is software that provides a generic template of functionality which can be selectively changed and enhanced by writing additional code. **Materialize** is a modern, responsive, front-end framework based on Material Design. In short, Materialize has done most of the heavy lifting for you in terms of a cohesive visual language. Materialize provides a default set of stylized components that you can incorporate into your own application and tweak as necessary.

To see it in action, check out some of these components.

## Why are both Material Design and the Materialize framework useful?

Not only can web developers use both Material Design the Materialize framework to create a stunning, unified experience across platforms and device sizes, they can use them to help close the gap between their taste versus their abilities.

To learn more about it, watch this video on [The Gap by Ira Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ResTHKVxf4)

### Exercise

After having explored the above resource, take a moment and write down your thoughts on how you've been feeling about your own gap.

## How does the Materialize framework compare against its competition?

Having received over [18,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize), Materialize fairs quite well when evaluated against its hundreds of rival competitors. However, Bootstrap and Foundation are currently the two largest and most popular front-end frameworks. These two frameworks are famous for providing everything plus the kitchen sink. While this sounds great on paper, it's actually a double-edged sword as they both have non-trivial learning curves. Also, both frameworks require web developers to write significant amounts of additional code to get their sites looking less drab right out of the box.

To see a comprehensive list of just their UI components, check out these links.

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/kitchen-sink.html)

In short, Materialize will help you produce better looking sites faster. And as a bonus, the skills you pick up while learning Materialize will help you figure out other front-end frameworks faster as well.

## How do you use the Materialize framework?

We'll use Materialize's [official documentation](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) to create a style guide that you can reference at any time.
