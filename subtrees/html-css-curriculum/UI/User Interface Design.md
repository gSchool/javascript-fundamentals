# User Interface Design

## Objectives

- Define what user interface design is.
- Explain why UI design is important to both users and developers.
- Style common user interface elements.
- Explain the how layout, color, texture, and typography are the foundation of good UI.

## What's user interface design?

A **user interface** is a shared boundary across which a user exchanges information with another entity. Often in computing, a user interface is the bridge between the immaterial world that exists in code and the material world that we physically interact with. Users provide input to the immaterial world through devices like a keyboard, mouse, trackpad, or touch screen.

**User interface design** is the implementation of these interfaces with a focus on user experience. The end goal of user interface design is to make the user's interactions as efficient as possible. UI design combines concepts from various fields such as visual design, interaction design, and information architecture.

With UI design, simplicity and clarity are paramount. A good interface is invisible to the user. In other words, a good interface doesn't waste the user's time by searching for controls or dealing with unhelpful error messages. Likewise, good interfaces maintain consistency and predictability. All user interactions are evaluated not only on their efficiency by also the satisfaction gained by the user while performing the task.

### Exercise

In your own words, write down what UI design entails. While you're writing, think about what's involved when designing good UI and write down some of the keywords that come to mind.

## Why is UI design important to both users and developers?

When the UI elements of a web application are well-styled, theyÂ all have a similar visual look and feel. This allows a user to leverage their experience with past UI elements to learn new ones quickly. For example, providing credit card information when checking out a shopping cart is a potential risk for identity theft. A user will feel more confident and be more likely to complete that interaction if they've already used a similar looking web form from a previous page.

In short, when you design a user interface, try to make it look as consistent as possible.

## How do you style common UI elements?

Here are some examples of common user interface elements.

### Form controls

A good user interface has consistent usage and appearance of form controls. Some examples include the `<button>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` tags.

### Navigation

A well designed user interface employs common design patterns for navigation that are intuitive to the user. Navigation can be presented to the user in many forms. Here are a few things to consider when designing navigation.

- Is the main navigation on the top or bottom, left or right?
- Is it centered or aligned?
- Does it change to an icon on mobile?
- Does the appearance change if a user is logged in?

### Informational Elements

Elements such as tooltips, popovers, toasts, notifications, modals, and error messages all provide feedback and feedforward to the user. Displaying key information at the right time can alleviate frustration and communicate the current state of the product to the user.

### Exercise

What are some other common interface components or patterns?

## How are layout, color, and typography the foundation of good UI?

### Layout

When laying out a page or application, be intentional and arrange UI elements logically. Separation of concerns also applies to the visual aspect of an user interface and aids in readability. For example, on a news site, the most important story is often placed at the of the top and consumes the most screen real-estate. Secondary stories are often grouped together and placed off to the side. Consider the spatial relationships between UI elements to help inform your users as to what's most important. When designing for responsiveness, maintain a similar hierarchy of information and grouping.

### Color and Texture

Attention can be directed or redirected with effective usage of color and texture. Use contrasting colors for to call out important information.

Likewise, subtle use of texture and patterns can add dimension to a background or containing element.

### Typography

As with color, be meaningful and logical with your typographical choices. A large range of fonts can be used by varying size, style, weight, typeface, color, and arrangement. Not only does this create a pleasing aesthetic but it also helps with overall readability and consistency.

A **font** is composed of the following characteristics.

- Font family (or typeface)
- Font style
- Font size

Here are some examples of different fonts.

| Font family | Font style | Font size |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Avenir Next | Normal     | 18 pixels |
| Avenir Next | Normal     | 15 pixels |
| Avenir Next | Bold       | 18 pixels |
| Helvetica   | Normal     | 18 pixels |

**TIP:** Most designers typically follow a general rule of using a maximum of two font families on a given project.
