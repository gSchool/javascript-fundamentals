# Wireframing

## Objectives

- Create thumbnail sketches for quick prototyping lots of ideas
- Describe content inventories and use them to support wireframing
- Understand common wireframe conventions (lorem ipsum, boxes with x's for images, [callout notes](http://uxmovement.com/wireframes/why-its-important-to-annotate-your-wireframes/), etc)
- Create wireframes to help guide application development

Wireframing is a way of visually diagramming a website's basic functionality with little detail. It allows us to discuss the basic structure of how a website is displayed without having to get into more specific details like colors or fonts. It is more advanced than a sketch but less advanced than a mockup or prototype.

## Sketches & Wireframing

While many websites seem unique, under the hood they are more alike than similar. Sketches and wireframes aim to simply create the design bones of the site. They give us a starting point for discussing how a site might look and feel and allow for faster iterations than more complex mockups.

Take a look at the following mockup for an event page:

![](https://students-gschool-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/298/attendee.png)

* There **IS** some text and information to give you a clearer picture of the page's intention.
* There **IS** a basic structure and layout for the form and page.
* There **IS NOT** specific details, images, or colors (the red highlight should be interpreted as a generic warning rather than a prescribed color)
* There **IS NOT** any particular style to the page. That is, all fonts are generic and no effects are noted.

The key takeaway is that this wireframe can give a team just enough to talk about in terms of the structure of the page. It allows us to focus on the structure versus focusing on some small detail someone doesn't like.

A free tool you can use to design wireframes is [wireframe.cc](http://wireframe.cc). Let's begin by dissecting an existing website into a wireframe.

Take a look at this version of the [node.js](http://nodejs.org) website:

When designing a wireframe, we want to focus on the content, the structure, and how elements on the page connect to one another.

<div class="media" style="padding: 2.5rem 2rem 1rem; border: 1px solid #c7254e; border-radius: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <div class="media-left" style="font-size: 3rem; color: #c7254e;">
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
  </div>
  <div class="media-body">
    <h3 class="media-heading">Exercise</h3>

    <p>Begin by taking a whiteboard and sketching out the main ideas on the page. What do you think is necessary versus not?</p>

    <p>Then, take your final sketch and create a wireframe with wireframe.cc.</p>

    <p>Finally, compare your wireframes with another student. What did you do differently from each other?</p>

</div>

There is not necessarily a _wrong_ answer for what should or should not go into a wireframe. Some people might put some specific heading text on their wireframes while others may have lorem ipsum text or simply a block of grey to connotate a heading. What you want to stay away from is **implementation details** -- visual clues that would inform the design as opposed to simply the structure.

Go back to your wireframe and think about it in terms of a grid. What should take up more width/weight on the page compared to other elements?

<div class="media" style="padding: 2.5rem 2rem 1rem; border: 1px solid #c7254e; border-radius: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <div class="media-left" style="font-size: 3rem; color: #c7254e;">
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
  </div>
  <div class="media-body">
    <h3 class="media-heading">Exercise</h3>

    <p>Find at least two [HTML5 Up](https://html5up.net/) templates you like and deconstruct the current site into a wireframe. Consider what is necessary to the structure and what is simply design or effect!</p>

## Information Architecture

### Content Inventories

* Make a list of all of the things your site should have
    * Images
    * Text
    * Navigation

### Information Hierarchy

* Understand the relationship between the things in your content inventory
* What's important
* What goes together
* "Information Architecture"

## Thumbnail Sketches

* Fast! 10 seconds or less
* Macro-layout
* Don't stay married to a design

## Building a Wireframe

* Placeholders
* Relationships
* Micro-interactions (how the user interacts with your content, and how their interactions affect the page.)

## Grids

https://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-it-grids/

* 12-column grids
* Gutters
* Ratios
* Draw on top of the grid

## Design for the web

* Design for flow
* Ignore the vertical
* "Mobile First"

## Markup

* What are all of the elements, semantically?
* What containers do they have?
* Box model

## How To Read a Wireframe

## Exercise

BlueWing Real Estate is looking to create a web application for home buyers. They want users to be able to register, search for houses and save them to their dashboards. You will need to create several wireframes. Follow this process to create a landing page wireframe:

1.  Write a content inventory
2.  Create 10 quick sketches (on paper or whiteboard)
3.  Pick 2 to make into wireframes
4.  Create both wireframes using your choice of wire-framing tool.

## Technical Terms

Sketch
> An incredibly brief visual representation of a website. Sketches are usually done by hand but, more importantly, they are quick.

Wireframe
> A wireframe is slightly more complex than a sketch but only in that it solidifies ideas in a presentable format. Wireframes are about content and structure, not design or detail.
