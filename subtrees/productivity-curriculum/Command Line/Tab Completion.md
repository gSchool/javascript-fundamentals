# Tab Completion

Hitting `<TAB>` autocompletes.  Hit `<TAB>` constantly. Try it right now! Type:

`$ cd ~/L` THEN HIT TAB!

This trick will save you so much time. Here's another trick, type:

`$ cd ~/` now DOUBLE TAP TAB. What happened?

This way you can easily see the competing outcomes of autocomplete. What happens if you type:

`$ cd ~/D` then double tap tab?

The competing options for me are `Desktop/`, `Documents/`, and `Downloads/`


## Benefits

The benefits to using `<TAB>` completion are threefold:

1. Autocomplete for you
1. Ensure paths are typed correctly
1. List current files in case you forgot


## Exercise

Spend three minutes navigating around your computer's file system from the command line. Use a mixture of relative and absolute paths to navigate around. See what dark corners you can discover in your operating system.
