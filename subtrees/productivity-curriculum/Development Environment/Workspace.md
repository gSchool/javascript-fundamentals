It's very important to have a consistent and well-organized workspace. We recommend the following directory structure

```
~
├── Projects
│   ├── week01
│   ├── week02
│   ├── week03
│   ├── week04
│   ├── week05
│   ├── week06
│   ├── week07
│   ├── week08
│   ├── week09
│   ├── week10
│   ├── week11
│   ├── week12
│   ├── week13
│   ├── week14
│   ├── week15
│   ├── week16
│   ├── week17
│   ├── week18
│   ├── week19
│   ├── week20
│   ├── week21
│   ├── week22
│   ├── week23
│   └── week24
```

In Terminal, run the following command.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/Projects/week01
```
