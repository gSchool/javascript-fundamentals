You may be surprised to learn that there are no universal keyboard shortcuts on macOS to quickly and neatly arrange application windows on the screen. For this, you'll need to install a tool called a window manager. There are many window managers available for macOS, but we recommend you use [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/).

### Install Magnet

To get started, [find Magnet](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) in the Mac App Store and press the "Install" button. Magnet costs $1.00 on the App Store. Hopefully this won't break the bank. üè¶

**NOTE:** Once installed, you can close the Mac App Store by pressing the `Command` + `Q` keys at the same time.

### Play with Magnet

Use Spotlight to launch Magnet by pressing the `Command` + `Spacebar` keys at the same time, typing the word "magnet" into the search field, and then pressing the `Enter` key.

Then, you'll be presented with a brief overview window of how Magnet works. Before closing the window, make sure you check the "Launch Magnet at login" checkbox at the bottom.

Unlike most apps, Magnet won't appear in the Dock at the bottom of the screen. Instead, its icon will appear in the menu bar at the top. Click on the icon to see a list of its window-arranging actions.

**NOTE:** The actions may be greyed out if you haven't selected a window to arrange.

For example, to maximize a window using Magnet, first open a Finder window by clicking on its icon in the Dock.

Once opened, press the `Option` + `Control`+ `Enter` keys at the same time to maximize the window.

It's important to note the distinction between a maximized window and a  fullscreened window. When a window is **maximized**, you can still switch between applications by pressing the `Command` + `Tab` keys like usual. However, when a window is **fullscreened**, you cannot tab-switch between applications anymore. Instead, you must swipe left or right with 3 fingers on the trackpad. For this reason, we recommend that you get in the habit of using maximized windows rather than fullscreened windows. In the end, you'll be much more productive.

To make a window cover the left half of the screen, press the `Option` + `Control` + `‚Üê` keys.

To make a window cover the right half of the screen, press the `Option` + `Control` + `‚Üí` keys.

To center a window on the screen, press the `Option` + `Control` + `C` keys.
