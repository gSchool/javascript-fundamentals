You may be surprised to learn that there are no universal keyboard shortcuts on macOS to quickly and neatly arrange application windows on the screen. For this, you'll need to install a tool called a window manager. There are many window managers available for macOS, but we recommend you use [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/).

### Install Spectacle

To get started, visit the [Spectacle homepage](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) and click the "Download Spectacle" button. Open your `Downloads` directory, double click the archive file to unzip it, and drag the application icon to your `Applications` directory.

### Configure Spectacle

Try out Spectacle by opening up a window in Chrome and pressing `Command` + `Option` + `Left / Right / Up / Down`. Your Chrome window should move around the screen and take up half the space! You can do this with any program so you could have Atom on one side of the screen and your terminal on the other.

Unfortunately, some of Spectacle's native commands now override the ability to switch between tabs on both our terminal and in Chrome! Let's fix those by setting up custom bindings. Instead of `Command` + `Option` + [Some Direction], we're going to do `Command` + `Option` + `Control` + [Some Direction].

Open up Preferences in Spectacle, and first delete the keybindings for Next Display and Previous Display.

Next, click the relevant bindings and then simply press the new keyboard commands you'd like to use.

That's it! You can now do all the things with your keyboard!
