[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a messaging application that brings team communication together into one simple place.

### Install Slack

While it's possible to use Slack in your web browser, you'll find the native Slack application for macOS much more convenient for everyday use. To get started, [find Slack](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12) in the Mac App Store and press the "Install" button.

**NOTE:** Once installed, you can close the Mac App Store by pressing the `Command` + `Q` keys at the same time.

### Configure Slack

Now, use Spotlight to launch the Slack app by pressing the `Command` + `Spacebar` keys at the same time, typing the word "slack" into the search field, and then pressing the `Enter` key.
