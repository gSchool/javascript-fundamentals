# Typing

## Objectives

By the end of Q1 you should be able to:

- Touch type English at 40WPM or more
- Touch type Code at 25WPM or more

# Why is it important?

A developer spends a great deal of time on a keyboard. For both productivity and health reasons, it is an important skill to master. Here are just a few arguments:

- The less you have to think about typing the more you can focus on the task at hand.
- Just like a musician missing a note, mistyping a word can significantly throw off your focus.
- Repetitive stress injuries and carpal tunnel are very real. Typing with proper form and posture can go a long way to avoiding any typing related health issues.

## Exercise
