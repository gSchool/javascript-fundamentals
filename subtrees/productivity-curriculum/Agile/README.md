# Agile

## Objectives

* Distinguish agile from traditional project management
* Describe the scrum process
* Define the roles of product owner, Scrum Master, developer
* Define story, epic, velocity, backlog, and sprint

## Waterfall - the "bad" way ðŸ’€

The term Waterfall was coined as an example of what not to do. Yet, a lot of companies do just this.

In Waterfall, project management looks like this:

- Everything is planned up front.
- All features are developed from the start.
- Tested at the end.
- Shipped to the customer.

But what happens when:

- You only get 80% of that done?
- Project requirements changes?
