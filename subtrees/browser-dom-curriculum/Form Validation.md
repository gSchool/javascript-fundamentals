# Form Validation with JavaScript

### Entry Ticket

You should have read [the HTML5 Form Validation Article](../html-css-curriculum/HTML/Form Validation.md).

In order to start this Learning Experience, you need to be able to:

* Select form elements with Javascript (vanilla or jQuery)
* Access properties on an object and manipulate them
* Create new DOM elements with Javascript (vanilla or jQuery)

For more complex checks we will want to use our knowledge of JavaScript. These checks can range from checking to make sure two passwords are the same to checking to see whether or not a specific username is already taken. JavaScript Validations almost always fit the following steps:

1. Select the value of the input(s) you're testing while the input(s) is being changed or on submit
1. Run some kind of check against it
1. If there's an error, surface it the user
1. If there's not an error, continue

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Read the values from your form with JS
* Check the values you've read with JS to make sure they are what they need to be
* Listen to form events like submit, and show errors
* Program defensively against faulty form input

### Key Terms

* Default Action
* Input Value
* Event Handler

### Why?

As a web developer, you will spend just an obscene amount of time working on HTML forms. Form validation is a large part of what is project-specific, and dependent on what's called "business logic". Because it varies from project to project, what gets validated and how, according to what needs, is something that's always being tweaked, prodded and updated. 9 times out of 10 when you collect information from a user, it's going to be from a form, and you want the user to have a nice experience.

We're also validating our form input because our programs can't work without proper inputs. Writing simple programs up until this point means only one person has been using your program: you. In the future, this won't be the case- sometimes forms are confusing if you don't know how they work in advance. Your users will often make mistakes, and will often need to be corrected in an expedient way that encourages the user to continue interacting with the form.

#### Accessing values

Not every form can be checked with a simple "type" field. Also, [not every browser](http://caniuse.com/#search=type%3D) can use every type. So, we need to do some validation using jQuery.

There are a number of validation libraries that we can use, that will allow us to validate our forms using code someone else has written. Rather than doing that, however, we need to understand how these libraries go about doing what they do, which we'll do by doing some implementation.

First, let's look at how to go about getting the values of the form:

**Get the value of an `input` element**

Given: `<input type="phone" name="phone" id="phone">`

```javascript
//jQuery
var phoneValue = $("#phone").val();
//Vanilla
var phoneValue = document.getElementById("phone").
```

Using either of these techniques, we can access the current value of any `input` element. This also works for `textarea` elements as well.

Take a look at the code below for how to access other kinds of form input through **vanilla javascript**.

```javascript
var form = document.querySelector('#some-form');
var input = document.querySelector('#some-input');

document.forms; // Get all forms on a page
form.elements; // Get all form elements
input.type.toLowerCase(); // Get input type (radio, checkbox, text, etc.)
input.value; // Get input value
input.name; // Get input name
input.checked; // Get the checked status of a checkbox or radio button
input.disabled; // Get input disabled status
```

**jQuery Version**

```javascript
var form = $('#some-form');
var input = $('#some-input');

input.val(); // Get input value
input.getAttr("name"); // Get input name
input[0].checked; // Get the checked status of a checkbox or radio button
input[0].disabled; // Get input disabled status
```

[(why we're using .checked)](https://jsperf.com/prop-vs-ischecked/5)


#### When to access values

Now that we know how to access values, we need to know when to access them. If we were to use the above code when the page loads, we would only see blank or placeholder values. Why? Because we need to wait to check these until the user tries to submit the form, or until the user is done filling out the field.

**.on("submit")**  

In order to check the form when the user hits the "I'm finished filling out this form button", we need to listen for the "submit" action on the form. *Remember, we need to select the form, not the submit button.* This is for when you want to validate the entire form at once.

```javascript
$("#myForm").on("submit", function(){
	// do entire form validation here
})

```

**.on("blur")**  

If we want to check a field as soon as a user is done typing, we can listen to the "blur" event. The blur event fires as soon as a field loses focus.

```javascript
$("#myInput").on("blur", function(){
	// do single input validation here
})

```

#### What do I do if there's an error?

A typical pattern is to display either next to the incorrectly filled out element, or a the top of the form, a new DOM element that lists the error in question. Try to be descriptive, tell the user what they did wrong- did they miss filling out the field, or did they just forget to put dashes in their phone number?

When you bind an event handler to something that has a _default action_, the handler will fire and then the default action will happen. A default action is something like a form's submission to the location that's in the action property, or the navigation that happens when you click a link. In order to render errors, you have to stop the default action. One way is to use `event.preventDefault();`, but simply calling `return false` from within a jQuery event handler will stop the default event from occuring.


```javascript
$("#myForm").on("submit", function(){

    if (some_error_condition) {

	    var errDiv = $('<div class="error">Please fix your phone number</div>')

        $("#myForm").append(errDiv);

        return false; // This tells the submission not to happen
    }
})


```


### Exercise
This should take you about 1.5 hours to complete.

## Reflect
Let's reflect on what we've learned.

### Self-Assessment

Howâ€™d you do? Go back to the "Objectives" section. Go through each one and ask yourself:

- Have I completed this objective?
- What concrete evidence do I have that I've completed the objective?

Rate yourself 1 through 4 for each objective in terms of competence (4 being the highest). If you rate yourself a 2 or below, please notify an instructor for additional help.

If you haven't completed an objective, or you can't define a term, take a few minutes to try to fill in any gaps.

### Questions

* Why do we need to do form validation inside an event listener?
* What is a better experience for the user- using the `required` attribute, or using JS to ensure all required fields are checked?
* Why might browser validation not be enough?
* What would happen if someone used console Javascript to submit their form, bypassing your validation?
