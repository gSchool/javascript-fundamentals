# TODO

- Add bonus tests for https://github.com/expressjs/method-override
- Write flash tests that require https://github.com/expressjs/express-messages
- `validate` makes network calls - is there a local validator we can use?  Or can we make it async?
- cheerio should add a val if it isn't there
- integrate https://github.com/gSchool/express_intro_exercise_puppies
